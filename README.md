# Swiss_Maps
## a.k.a "a first attempt to do something"

This is a project based on a tutorial to create a simple data map using D3.js http://data-map-d3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
The expected result should look like this http://lvonlanthen.github.io/data-map-d3/
With code available here https://github.com/lvonlanthen/data-map-d3
