# Swiss_Maps
## a.k.a "a first attempt to do something"

This is a project based on a [tutorial](http://data-map-d3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to create a simple data map using D3. 

The expected result should look like [this](http://lvonlanthen.github.io/data-map-d3/).

With code available [here](https://github.com/lvonlanthen/data-map-d3/).
